I created a website for my wife ( http://www.mrs-lodges-libary.com ). She sells some of her lessons on TeachersPayTeachers.com, but unfortunately they don't have any API to pull the lessons she posts there. So, I created a little web scraper script that will pull her free lessons, and build a carousel with it.
