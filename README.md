This is a web scraper that will take lesson information from Teachers Pay Teachers and organize it into a carousel.

Right now it only pulls free lessons (my initial intention) but is restricted to the first page.

Future plans will follow paginated links and organize the data into a javascript object rather than simply manipulating the scraped data.
